# Martian Token Crowdsale

A fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant is created and minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.
